                    license to use the font.</p>
                <p class="license-body">This agreement takes effect when you download or use the font, and is governed
                    by the laws of the State of New York. I expressly reserve all rights not granted to you in this

                    license, a “font” is defined as the font software, the designs embodied therein, and all sup-
                    plemental materials provided along with the font software, as well as any future versions or
                    upgrades.</p>

                <p class="license-body"><span class="license-body-strong">Limitations:</span> This license is governed
                    by “limitations” that define the maximum number of allowed desktop computer installations of the
                    font, unique website visitors for websites using the font, and number of mobile apps and e-books
                    using the font. The limitations of your license can be found in your Order Summary.</p>
                <p class="license-body">If you do not have an order summary, if the limitation for a use is not listed
                    in it, or if it includes the phrase “For testing purposes only,” you must use the font only for
                    internal testing purposes. You must upgrade to a full and appropriate license before delivering or
                    publishing any such use of the font.

                    to
                    prevent
                    unlicensed users from accessing, distributing, or re-serving the font file.</p>

                    vectors. You may also subset and modify the font software itself for your own purposes; any derived
                    versions
                    of
                    the font remain my property and are subject to the same license and limitations.</p>

                    embedding
                    permissions, extracting the complete font from the document, and creating or editing content using
                    the
                    font.
                </p>

                    bureau
                    that will use the font on your behalf, as long as the total number of simultaneous installations
                    does
                    not
                    exceed
                    your license limitations. They must agree to the terms of this license, use the font on your behalf

                <h2 class="license-title-2">Terms of Web Use</h2>
                <p class="license-body">This license allows you to use the font on websites using CSS @font-face, so
                    long as
                    the
                    estimated traffic on that website meets the limitation defined in your order summary.</p>

                <p class="license-body"><span class="license-body-strong">Web Traffic:</span> Web traffic is measured by
                    monthly unique visitors, or if your website does not
                    record
                    those, by monthly pageviews. If your website exceeds the web traffic limitation for six consecutive
                    months,
                    you
                    must contact me to upgrade your license. I reserve the right to inspect or monitor your use.</p>

                <p class="license-body"><span class="license-body-strong">Domains:</span> You are not limited to a
                    specific number of domains or subdomains, so long as

                    websites
                    using the font are operated by you, and the cumulative estimated traffic does not exceed the
                    limitation.
                </p>
                <p class="license-body"><span class="license-body-strong">Formats:</span> You may only serve web fonts
                    in WOFF, WOFF2, EOT, and SVG formats.</p>

                    website’s server or on a CDN (content delivery
                    network)
                    where
                    you host other website assets. You must make a reasonable effort to prevent unauthorized use or
                    distribution
                    of
                    the font. If the server’s directory structure is publicly accessible, you must include the text of
                    this
                    license
                    alongside the hosted files and clearly mark them as licensed assets.</p>

                    this
                    agreement remains in effect until the license is terminated. If the license is terminated, you must
                    discontinue
                    use of the font and delete all copies that you control or possess.</p>
                <p class="license-body">If you wish to terminate this agreement, delete the font and notify me. If you
                    terminate
                    within 30 days of your original purchase, I will refund your payment.</p>
                <p class="license-body">I reserve the right to terminate the license if you breach any term of this
                    agreement,
                    without the obligation of notice or opportunity to cure. Grounds for termination include:</p>

                    other breaches of the terms stated above.
                </p>

                <p class="license-body"><span class="license-body-strong">Liability:</span> Under no circumstances am I
                    responsible
                    or liable for any issues or harm or physical damages that may result from the use of the font, even
                    if
                    notified
                    in advance.</p>
                <p class="license-body">If you encounter a problem with the font, I will make a good faith effort to
                    provide
                    you
